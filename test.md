# A Poem

The code compiles at break of dawn,
A function here, a loop withdrawn.
The tests run green, the build is clean,
The finest code you've ever seen.

Through merge conflicts and rebases long,
The codebase grows both deep and strong.
Each commit a step, each branch a thread,
Weaving something whole from all we've said.
