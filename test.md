# A Poem

The code compiles at break of dawn,
A function here, a loop withdrawn.
The tests run green, the build is clean,
The finest code you've ever seen.

The debugger pauses, the stack unwinds,
A hidden bug surrenders, resigns.
We trace the fault to line ninety-three,
And fix it there, then finally breathe.

Through merge conflicts and rebases long,
The codebase grows both deep and strong.
Each commit a step, each branch a thread,
Weaving something whole from all we've said.
